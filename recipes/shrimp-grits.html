    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Shrimp</li>
        <li>Grits</li>
        <li>Creole Seasoning</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Set a large pot over medium heat, then stir together 3 cups of chicken stock and 1 cup of milk and bring to a simmer.
        </li>
        <li>Add the grits and whisk constantly for around 1 minute. Cover the pot and reduce the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring every 3-4 minutes, until the liquid is absorbed and the grits have a creamy texture. If they seem too dry, add more milk or stock as needed. Remove from heat and stir in 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 teaspoon of salt.
        </li>
        <li>While the grits cook, heat a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon strips and cook for 2-3 minutes until crispy. Transfer the bacon to a plate lined with paper towels using a slotted spoon. Drain the grease from the pan, reserving 1 tablespoon.
        </li>
        <li>Add the chopped onion and green pepper to the pan with the reserved bacon grease and cook for 2-3 minutes until softened.
        </li>
        <li>Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Then, add the shrimp and season with 1 teaspoon of Creole seasoning. Cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the shrimp is cooked through. Transfer the shrimp to a plate.
        </li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in the pan, then add the flour and cook for around 1 minute, stirring constantly. Stir in 1 cup of chicken stock, 2-3 teaspoons of Creole seasoning (to taste), and 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce. Cook for around 1-2 minutes until the sauce is thickened.
        </li>
    </ol>
